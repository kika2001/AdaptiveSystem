## What is an Adaptive System
An adaptive game/dynamic game difficulty balancing is a system in games which adapts to the gameplay style of the player giving him a better experience or at least more challenging.
Some games use this system to change the narrative, which is very common in interactive storytelling where you can choose the path and take certain actions which use karma or similar features.
## Type of system which this system is based
The Adaptive system was created based on the DDA system (Dynamic Difficulty Adaptation) because its a concept easy to use when talking about small data to be analysed. The system uses a ratio for difficulty, where each player will have a different difficulty depending on how good they are. 
Player with low skill playing on hard will have it more easy than pro players playing on hard, but both will have difficulties because it adapts to their skill.
